Elastic Beanstalk supports two methods of saving configuration option settings. Configuration files in YAML or JSON format can be included in your application's source code in a directory named .ebextensions and deployed as part of your application source bundle. You create and manage configuration files locally.

Saved configurations are templates that you create from a running environment or JSON options file and store in Elastic Beanstalk. Existing saved configurations can also be extended to create a new configuration.
